	Abstract = {Aiming at the positioning problem of wireless sensor network node location, an improved DV-hop positioning algorithm is proposed in this paper, together with its basic principle and realization issues. The proposed method can improve location accuracy without increasing hardware cost for sensor node. Simulation results show that it has good positioning accuracy and coverage. The influences of anchor nodes on the DV-hop algorithm are also explored in the paper.},
