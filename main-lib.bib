@article{XuYang2017,
	Abstract = {Integrating wireless sensor network (WSN) into the emerging computing paradigm, e.g., cyber-physical social sensing (CPSS), has witnessed a growing interest, and WSN can serve as a social network while receiving more attention from the social computing research field. Then, the localization of sensor nodes has become an essential requirement for many applications over WSN. Meanwhile, the localization information of unknown nodes has strongly affected the performance of WSN. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) as a typical range-based algorithm for positioning sensor nodes in WSN could achieve accurate location with hardware saving, but is sensitive to environmental noises. Moreover, the original distance vector hop (DV-HOP) as an important range-free localization algorithm is simple, inexpensive and not related to the environment factors, but performs poorly when lacking anchor nodes. Motivated by these, various improved DV-HOP schemes with RSSI have been introduced, and we present a new neural network (NN)-based node localization scheme, named RHOP-ELM-RCC, through the use of DV-HOP, RSSI and a regularized correntropy criterion (RCC)-based extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm (ELM-RCC). Firstly, the proposed scheme employs both RSSI and DV-HOP to evaluate the distances between nodes to enhance the accuracy of distance estimation at a reasonable cost. Then, with the help of ELM featured with a fast learning speed with a good generalization performance and minimal human intervention, a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) on the basis of ELM-RCC is used to implement the optimization task for obtaining the location of unknown nodes. Since the RSSI may be influenced by the environmental noises and may bring estimation error, the RCC instead of the mean square error (MSE) estimation, which is sensitive to noises, is exploited in ELM. Hence, it may make the estimation more robust against outliers. Additionally, the least square estimation (LSE) in ELM is replaced by the half-quadratic optimization technique. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms other traditional localization schemes.},

@article{Gunraj20161067,
	Abstract = {Text messaging is one of the most frequently used computer-mediated communication (CMC) methods. The rapid pace of texting mimics face-to-face communication, leading to the question of whether the critical non-verbal aspects of conversation, such as tone, are expressed in CMC. Much of the research in this domain has involved large corpus analyses, focusing on the contents of texts, but not how receivers comprehend texts. We ask whether punctuation -- specifically, the period -- may serve as a cue for pragmatic and social information. Participants read short exchanges in which the response either did or did not include a sentence-final period. When the exchanges appeared as text messages, the responses that ended with a period were rated as less sincere than those that did not end with a period. No such difference was found for handwritten notes. We conclude that punctuation is one cue used by senders, and understood by receivers, to convey pragmatic and social information.},

@article{Tomic2016,
	Abstract = {Based on the improvements of the original DV-Hop localization algorithm, three new localization algorithms (iDV-Hop1, iDV-Hop2, and Quad DV-Hop) are presented in this article. In iDV-Hop1 and iDV-Hop2, all steps of the original DV-Hop are kept, and several steps based on geometry improvements of the localization problem are added in order to obtain better localization accuracy. The third algorithm (Quad DV-Hop) formulated the localization problem as bounded least squares problem, to be solved by quadratic programming. Simulations are carried out on the four different types of network topology by varying nodes communication range, number of anchor nodes and number of nodes. Comparison of our algorithms with the original DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop algorithms are given. It is shown that iDV-Hop1 algorithm can significantly reduce the localization error (up to three times) in scenarios with irregular topologies compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop. In scenarios with regular topologies, iDV-Hop2 and Quad DV-Hop showed better performance compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop (up to 11 {\%} lower localization error).},
